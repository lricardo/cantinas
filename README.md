## University of Aveiro Canteen's menu app

This app it's an homework for Mobile Computation class. I think it's beautiful so, I want to share it.

It consists in two views:
* The main menu, which shows all opened canteens, based on the system time;
* The detail menu, which shows the chosen menu

## Features

* Offline mode
* Only shows the available menus, given the system time
